# String Manipulation
# ===================
#
# Now we will start playing around with strings. Remember
# that the string class is immutable, which means that
# you cannot change the characters of a given string. 
# However, you can use string methods to create a new string
# that is changed in the way you like. 
#
# You can find much information in the 
# [documentation](http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods)


# Strings (sequences of characters) are defined by putting
# them into quotation marks. 
a = "Hello"
b = 'World'

# strings can be joined by the `+` operator
greeting = a + " " + b + "!"
print(greeting)

# even multi-line strings are allowed with triple-quotation (multi-line strings
# can also be used as code comments)
longstring = """Hello,
World!"""
print(longstring)

# you can select substrings
d = greeting[0:5]
e = longstring[7:12]

# strings are compared with the `==` (equals) operator
print(a == d == "Hello")
print(e == "World")
print(e == "Welt")

# Strings are immutable, you can't assign to a string
# >>> a = "Hello, world!"
# >>> a[0:5] = "Adios"
# TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment

# Good string replacement example
a = "Hello, world!"
b = a.replace("Hello", "Goodbye")
print(b)

# There are many more exciting string methods, just 
# take a look around in the documentation. Recommended
# reading:
#	- str.strip()
#	- str.split()
#	- str.join()
#	- str.find()
#	- str.lower()
#	- str.upper()
#	- str.startswith()
#	[- str.format(), be patient with this one, it will 
#	   be clearer later on]
