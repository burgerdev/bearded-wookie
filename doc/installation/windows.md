Installation
============

You can download the latest version at the [python website](http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.3.2/). Be sure to choose the right version (32 or 64 bit) for your system. 

Integrated Development Environment
==================================

The IDLE development environment is included in this release, and will do fine for the first steps. If you want to try a different editor, take a look at [PyScripter](http://code.google.com/p/pyscripter/) and the [PyDev plugin](http://pydev.org/) for Eclipse.

For a more advanced python shell, [IPython](http://ipython.org/install.html) is also available on windows, but the installation process is a bit lengthy.

Python On A Stick
=================

If you ever need your python tools but don't have proper admin privileges, you can get a portable python version [here](http://portablepython.com/).
