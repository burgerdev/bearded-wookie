Installation
============

Python is preinstalled on Mac OS X. If you want a newer package check out the [python site](http://www.python.org/getit/mac/).

Integrated Development Environment
==================================

The IDLE system is also preinstalled. More advanced editors are [NetBeans](http://wiki.netbeans.org/Python) and [PyDev for Eclipse](http://pydev.org/). 

You can also use your favourite editor to edit python source files, and run them in the terminal by typing 

```bash
python myProgram.py
```

Most OS X editors have builtin syntax highlighting, but you might need to activate it in the settings. 

The [IPython shell](http://ipython.org/install.html) is also available for Mac.
