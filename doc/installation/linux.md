Installation
============

On linux, you have to know your package manager. Install the packages 

  * python (on some distros python3, e.g. ubuntu) and
  * ipython (ipython3)


Integrated Development Environment
==================================

As a development environment, your distros native editor will probably do fine (try kate on KDE, or gedit on Gnome). An integrated terminal is very comfortable for quickly running python scripts. For larger projects, you can use KDevelop or [PyDev for Eclipse](Http://pydev.org).
